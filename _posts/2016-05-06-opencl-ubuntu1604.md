title: AMD OpenCL on Ubuntu 16.04
author: Wladimir J. van der Laan
---

I was interested in using my brand new "gaming" card for parallel computation.
Of course I want to do this by using using free software if possible, not
by installing proprietary drivers.

Ubuntu 16.04 has an `mesa-opencl-icd`
package, as well as the `libclc-*` packages that should be enough to support
open source OpenCL on AMD hardware.

However [it turned out that my card is not supported
yet](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libclc/+bug/1577835).

Having gained some experience from etnaviv I wasn't exactly looking forward to
building the Mesa graphics driver and all its dependencies from source.
Thankfully Paulo Dias supplies
[a PPA](https://launchpad.net/~paulo-miguel-dias/+archive/ubuntu/mesa) that has
the bleeding edge packages build directly from LLVM and Mesa necessary.

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:paulo-miguel-dias/mesa 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libclc-amdgcn mesa-opencl-icd
```

I experimented in a headless machine so did not have to worry about graphics
drivers and X. If you do, be careful as this may (or may not) break the
graphical environment. The following section should help in that case.

### Removing a PPA

To revert to standard Ubuntu drivers:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
```

Enumerating devices
--------------------

To see if everything went well, you can run the following to list the OpenCL
platforms and devices. Get [devices.c]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets{{ page.id }}/devices.c) and compile it

```bash
$ gcc devices.c -o devices -O2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so.1
$ ./devices
```
Example output:

```
1. Platform
  Profile: FULL_PROFILE
  Version: OpenCL 1.1 MESA 11.3.0-devel (padoka PPA)
  Name: Clover
  Vendor: Mesa
  Extensions: cl_khr_icd
1. Device: AMD TONGA (DRM 3.1.0, LLVM 3.9.0)
 1.1 Hardware version: OpenCL 1.1 MESA 11.3.0-devel (padoka PPA)
 1.2 Software version: 11.3.0-devel (padoka PPA)
 1.3 OpenCL C version: OpenCL C 1.1 
 1.4 Parallel compute units: 28
```

Running an OpenCL test
-----------------------

A small OpenCL example that squares a bunch of numbers can be found
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets{{ page.id }}/hello.c). Additionally it dumps the binary to disk for
disassembly (see below).

```bash
$ gcc hello.c -o hello -O2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so.1
$ ./hello 
success: got back 1 binaries, total size 8450
binary 0: size 8450 dumped to square0.gallium_bin
Computed '1024/1024' correct values!
```

Disassembly
------------

I'm always interested in how the underlying machine code looks.
A good tool for assembling and disassembling binaries for this particular architecture
is [CLRX](http://clrx.nativeboinc.org/).

~~I needed to do some patching~~
~~before it would accept the binaries, possibly because Gallium or LLVM switched~~
~~the format recently. I [reported this](https://github.com/CLRX/CLRX-mirror/issues/3) so possibly by the time you read~~
~~this it has been fixed and you don't need the patch.~~ This was fixed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CLRX/CLRX-mirror.git
cd CLRX-mirror
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
export CLRXPATH=$PWD/programs
```

This will create an executable `clrxdisasm` in `programs`.

The disassembler doesn't, for Gallium binaries, currently detect the GPU architecture
(I am not even sure whether this is encoded), so this has to be specified
explicitly. If not, the instructions will look strange, as there is a
significant difference between GCN 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 ISAs.

Using it with the [square0.gallium_bin]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets{{ page.id }}/square0.gallium_bin) that
was produced by `hello.c`

```bash
${CLRXPATH}/clrxdisasm -g tonga square0.gallium_bin
```

This should give an output such as

```
.gallium
.gpu Tonga
.kernel square
.text
square:
        s_load_dword    s3, s[0:1], 0x18
        s_nop           0x0
        s_load_dword    s4, s[0:1], 0x34
        s_waitcnt       lgkmcnt(0)
        s_mul_i32       s3, s3, s2
        v_add_u32       v0, vcc, s3, v0
        v_cmp_gt_u32    vcc, s4, v0
        s_and_saveexec_b64 s[2:3], vcc
        s_xor_b64       s[2:3], exec, s[2:3]
        s_cbranch_execz .L136_0
        s_load_dwordx2  s[4:5], s[0:1], 0x2c
        s_nop           0x0
        s_load_dwordx2  s[0:1], s[0:1], 0x24
        v_ashrrev_i32   v1, 31, v0
        v_lshlrev_b64   v[0:1], 2, v[0:1]
        s_waitcnt       lgkmcnt(0)
        v_add_u32       v2, vcc, s4, v0
        v_mov_b32       v3, s5
        v_addc_u32      v3, vcc, v1, v3, vcc
        v_add_u32       v4, vcc, s0, v0
        v_mov_b32       v0, s1
        v_addc_u32      v5, vcc, v1, v0, vcc
        flat_load_dword v0, v[4:5]
        s_waitcnt       vmcnt(0) & lgkmcnt(0)
        v_mul_f32       v0, v0, v0
        flat_store_dword v[2:3], v0
        s_waitcnt       vmcnt(0) & lgkmcnt(0)
.L136_0:
        s_or_b64        exec, exec, s[2:3]
        s_endpgm
```

There is also an assembler `clrxdisasm` that should be able to convert this
back to a binary, but I haven't experimented with that yet.

This reminds me of the old times with [decuda and cudasm](https://github.com/laanwj/decuda), except that there is no need for any
reverse engineering here. AMD helpfully provides everything necessary to write
free software drivers.
